# Understanding model output
The *DiatomSizeESS* model outputs two tables of results, and two sets of plots, after each simulation run.

## Tabular results
Tabular results are shown in the noteboook cell under the **Run simulation** button, and also saved in the text files [](standingstocks.txt) and [](./losses.txt)[^over].
```{figure} ./Images/DESS_7.png
:label: out1
:alt: DiatomSizeESS tabular output
:align: center
:width: 500

Top: Table of standing stock statistics, averaged over the last mixing interval.
Bottom: Table of biovolume losses, averaged over the last mixing interval.
```
In these tables, the columns represent: $i$ - size class, $s$ - size, $10^s$ - cell volume, $N$ - number of cells, $Q/Q_{min}$ - fractional nutrient quota, $BV$ - biovolume, $M$ - "background" mortality, $S$ - sinking mortality, $L$ - mixing event mmortality

## Graphical results
Two sets of graphical results are presented:
1. Period-averaged results, for all mixing intervals in the simulation.  
  These plots show the long-term trends of diatom populations and nutrient.
  "Period-averaged" means the variation between mixing events is averaged out, so that long-term trends are easier to see.
2. Results during the last mixing interval.

Left: Plots of period-averaged fractional quotas ($Q/Q_{min}$, biovolume ($BV$) and mixed layer nutrient concentration ($R$) over the whole simulation run.
Right: Plots of fractional quotas ($Q/Q_{min}$, biovolume ($BV$) and mixed layer nutrient concentration ($R$) over the last mixing interval.
```
