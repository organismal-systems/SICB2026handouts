# Activity 2: Data collection
The following steps take you through Activity 1.

## Part 1: Variation of biovolume and nutrient concentration in diatom monocultures

In a spreadsheet, start a table in which to record the winners of competitions in mixed layers with different mixing intervals:

Table for recording dominant variants for different mixing intervals.
```
Data are collected in a nested loop:

- For each mixing interval, $T_{mix} = 8, 16, 32, 64$:
  - For each cell size class, $i = 0, 3, 7$
	- Execute the simulation sequence:  
	*Start a population $\rightarrow$ seed a monoculture $\rightarrow$ run the simulation $\rightarrow$ record the data*
	
- Make *X-Y* charts of your tables to visualize your results.

## Part 2: Variation of biovolume and nutrient concentration in diverse diatom cultures

Data are collected in a nested loop:
- For each mixing interval, $T_{mix} = 8, 16, 32, 64$:
  - Execute the simulation sequence:  
	*Start a population $\rightarrow$ seed "all" size classes $\rightarrow$ run the simulation $\rightarrow$ record the data*
