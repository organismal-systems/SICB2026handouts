# Activity 1: Trophic impacts
In this Activity, we assume that that, in [Litchman *et al.* (2009)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.0810891106)'s model of diatom populations in mixed layers:
> - The size-specific standing stock of diatoms is a **proxy** for primary production and availability to grazers and pathogens.
> - The mixed layer nutrient is a **proxy** for the intensity of competition among primary producers.
We use these proxies to address questions about the trophic impacts of diatoms in mixed layers.

## Part 1: Variation of biovolume and nutrient concentration in diatom monocultures
> - How do diatom size and mixed layer characteristics affect availability to grazers and pathogens?
> - Does primary production increase or decrease with different mixed layer characteristics?
> - Do mixed layer characteristics affect the intensity of competition by diatoms for limiting nutrients?
### Procedure
1. Collect model results for a series of diatom sizes and mixed layer intervals, as shown in [these instructions](./Activity1data.md).
2. Assess whether:
   - Standing stocks of different sized diatoms in monoculture suggest differences in primary production and availability to grazers and pathogens.
   - Different sized diatoms are likely to have different effects on competing primary producers.  

What are the strengths and limitations of this analysis?

## Part 2: Variation of biovolume and nutrient concentration in diverse diatom cultures

> - In diverse diatom populations, are the best competitors also the variants that maximize or minimize availability and competitive intensity?
### Procedure
1. Collect model results for "all" diatom sizes in a series of mixed layer intervals, as shown in [these instructions](./Activity1data.md).
2. Assess whether :
   - In initially diverse diatom populations, "winning" variants have relatively large or small primary production and availability to grazers and pathogens.
   - In initially diverse diatom populations, "winning" variants have relatively large or small effects on competing primary producers.
   
What are the strengths and limitations of this analysis?
