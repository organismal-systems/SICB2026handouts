# Activity 2: Competition and Evolutionarily Stable States
In this Activity, we explore [Litchman *et al.* (2009)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.0810891106)'s hypothesis that allometries of storage and growth explain the larger size distributions of diatom populations in marine compared to freshwater mixed layers.

Litchman *et al.* supported their hypothesis by showing that their model resulted in [Evolutionarily Stable States](./EvolutionarilyStableStates.md) in which larger diatom variants were favored over smaller diatom variants.
## Part 1: Variation of biovolume and nutrient concentration in diatom monocultures
In Part 1, you will assess their conclusions by using their model to ask:  
   > - What are the outcomes of competition among initially mixed populations of diatom variants?  
   > - Over which time periods do the outcomes of competition among initially mixed diatom populations approach their final state?
### Procedure
1. Collect model results for a series of diatom sizes and mixed layer intervals, as shown in [these instructions](./Activity1data.md).
2. Assess whether:
   - Standing stocks of different sized diatoms in monoculture suggest differences in primary production and availability to grazers and pathogens.
   - Different sized diatoms are likely to have different effects on competing primary producers.  

What are the strengths and limitations of this analysis?

## Part 2: Variation of biovolume and nutrient concentration in diverse diatom cultures

> - In diverse diatom populations, are the best competitors also the variants that maximize or minimize availability and competitive intensity?

1. Collect model results for "all" diatom sizes in a series of mixed layer intervals, as shown in [these instructions](./Activity1data.md).
2. Assess whether :
   - In initially diverse diatom populations, "winning" variants have relatively large or small primary production and availability to grazers and pathogens.
   - In initially diverse diatom populations, "winning" variants have relatively large or small effects on competing primary producers.
   
What are the strengths and limitations of this analysis?
