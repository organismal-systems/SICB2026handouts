# Activity 2: Competition and Evolutionarily Stable States
In this Activity, we explore [Litchman *et al.* (2009)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.0810891106)'s hypothesis that allometries of storage and growth explain the larger size distributions of diatom populations in marine compared to freshwater mixed layers.

Litchman *et al.* supported their hypothesis by showing that their model resulted in [Evolutionarily Stable States](./EvolutionarilyStableStates.md) in which larger diatom variants were favored over smaller diatom variants.
## Part 1: Variation of biovolume and nutrient concentration in diatom monocultures
In Part 1, you will assess their conclusions by using their model to ask:  
   > - What are the outcomes of competition among initially mixed populations of diatom variants?  
   > - Over which time periods do the outcomes of competition among initially mixed diatom populations approach their final state?
### Procedure
1. Collect model results for a series of diatom sizes and mixed layer intervals, as shown in [these instructions](./Activity2data.md).
2. Assess:
   - Which diatom variants appear to "win" competitions for nutrients in mixed layers with different mixing intervals, starting from a diverse initial diatom population?  
   - How long does it take to approach this steady state in which winning competitors exclude weaker competitors?

What do your results suggest about how we should interpret the results of these simulations to predict diatom populations in real mixed layers?

## Part 2: Do "winners" of competitions also form ESS's?
ESS's have advantages as summaries of evolutionary dynamics, because they are well-defined and often quick to calculate.
However, the requirement that the candidate variant be allowed to growth to steady state &ndash; thereby establishing the ambient nutrient concentration &ndash; means that 
- a variant can (in some models) be an ESS but not the dominant competitor in an initially mixed population; and
- a variant can (in some models) be  the dominant competitor in an initially mixed population but not an ESS.

> - In diverse diatom populations, are the best competitors also the variants that maximize or minimize availability and competitive intensity?

1. Collect model results for "all" diatom sizes in a series of mixed layer intervals, as shown in [these instructions](./Activity1data.md).
2. Assess whether :
   - In initially diverse diatom populations, "winning" variants have relatively large or small primary production and availability to grazers and pathogens.
   - In initially diverse diatom populations, "winning" variants have relatively large or small effects on competing primary producers.
   
What are the strengths and limitations of this analysis?
