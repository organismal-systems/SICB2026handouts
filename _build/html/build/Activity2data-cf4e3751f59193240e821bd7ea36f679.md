# Activity 2: Data collection
The following steps take you through Activity 1.

## Part 1: Variation of biovolume and nutrient concentration in diatom monocultures

In a spreadsheet, start a table in which to record the winners of competitions in mixed layers with different mixing intervals:

```
Data are collected in a nested loop:

- For each mixing interval, $T_{mix} = 1.5, 8, 18, 32$:
  - Execute the simulation sequence:  
	*Start a population $\rightarrow$ seed "all" size classes $\rightarrow$ run the simulation $\rightarrow$ record the winner*
Important:
- Make sure to run the simulation enough times to arrive at the true dominant variant &ndash; this can take **multiple runs**.
- Make sure to **record the approximate number of days** the model took for a dominant strain to emerge.

## Part 2: Variation of biovolume and nutrient concentration in diverse diatom cultures

Data are collected in a nested loop:
- For each mixing interval, $T_{mix} = 8, 16, 32, 64$:
  - Execute the simulation sequence:  
	*Start a population $\rightarrow$ seed "all" size classes $\rightarrow$ run the simulation $\rightarrow$ record the data*

- Make an *X-Y* chart of your table to visualize your results.
